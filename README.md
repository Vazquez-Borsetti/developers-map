# Interactive Plotly Chart: Map of Developers per Million Inhabitants
This interactive chart, created with Plotly, illustrates the number of developers per million inhabitants. 
The data is based on figures provided by GitHub in this post; https://github.blog/news-insights/octoverse/octoverse-2024/)
 and population data was obtained from: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/erikbruin/countries-of-the-world-iso-codes-and-population.
Discussion and Limitations:
The number of accounts reported by GitHub is used as an estimate of the number of developers. However, this raises the question: when does someone become a developer? Is it when they get paid to code? When they write their first "Hello, World"? Since there is no universal definition of a developer, defining it as someone who owns a GitHub account is both practical and reasonable. Nonetheless, this estimator might not hold the same meaning across different countries, inevitably introducing bias.
